  <p>
    &quot;Hi, I’m Unsha, an enthusiastic learner currently pursuing a Web and App Development course from Saylani.
    I’ve built a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, and I’m currently enhancing my skills in JavaScript to
    create more dynamic and interactive web experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to coding, I have basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, which helps me add a creative touch to my
    work. I’m passionate about growing my skills, exploring new technologies, and building user-friendly
    websites and applications.&quot;
